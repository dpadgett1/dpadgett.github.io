<p>Apart from teaching and writing, I enjoy spending time exploring the outdoors on my bike and on foot. I also compete in road races on my bike in the San Antonio area.</p>

<p>My desire to explore the outdoors has taken me on a number of adventures. The most one was a trip through New Mexico and Colorado that was filled with plenty of hiking and cycling. (The picture on the header was one I took in Sugarite Canyon State Park, near Raton, NM.)</p> 

<p>In the past few years I have taken on a number of more technical side projects related to writing and teaching. Among them are learning LaTeX and how to use GitHub and Jekyll to build this site.</p>
