<p>Apart from teaching and writing, I enjoy spending time exploring the outdoors on my bike and on foot. I also compete in road races on my bike in the San Antonio area.</p>

<p>My desire to explore the outdoors has taken me on a number of adventures. The most one was a trip through New Mexico and Colorado that was filled with plenty of hiking and cycling. (The picture on the header was one I took in Sugarite Canyon State Park, near Raton, NM.)</p> 

<p>In the past few years I have taken on a number of more technical side projects related to writing and teaching. Among those projects are learning how to write with LaTeX and how to use GitHub and Jekyll to build this site.</p>
