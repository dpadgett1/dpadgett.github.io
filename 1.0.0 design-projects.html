<h2><a href=/cw-assessment>Saving Time With User-Centered Design</a></h2>
<p> By adapting agile design principles, I digitized two components of an annual assessment cycle at the US Air Force Academy. Central to this project were two rubrics I designed and built in the Academy’s learning management system. These rubrics were easy to use, met the leadership’s requirements, used by 200 assesors, and saved Academy staff 915 hours of work per assessment cycle.</p>

<h2><a href=/ftb-redesign>Retooling The Faculty Toolbox</a></h2>
<p>My first design project at the US Air Force Academy was a redesign of the Faculty Toolbox, a website faculty use to learn about the Academy's learning management system. The redesign process illustrates the design system that I have implemented at the Academy. I started the project by conducting user research and building personas. Using that data, I determined that the site map and navigation need to be restructured. And, to better meet the needs of the faculty, I implemented a style guide and designed templates for the content that will be added to the website. After wireframing initial ideas for the templates, I built working prototypes for testing. This is still an active project, as future development of the website will be in response to faculty needs. But the Toolbox is already seeing a consistent increase in use (150 new users, which is a 27% increase, over the past year)&mdash;even as we continue to grant more faculty access to the site.</p>
