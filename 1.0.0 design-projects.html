<h2><a href=/cw-assessment>Saving Time With User-Centered Design</a></h2>
<p> By adapting agile design principles, I digitized two components of an annual assessment cycle at the US Air Force Academy. The final product from this project consisted of a collection of websites and rubrics built in the Academy’s learning management system that was easy to use, met the leadership’s requirements, used by 200 assesors, and saved Academy staff 915 hours of work per assessment cycle.</p>

<h2><a href=/ftb-redesign>Retooling The Faculty Toolbox</a></h2>
<p>My first design project at the US Air Force Academy was a redesign of the Faculty Toolbox, a website faculty use to learn about the Academy's learning management system. In redesigning the website, I updated the information architecture and user interface, and added functionality to the site to transform it from merely a repository of content to a hub for news, knowledge, and community. Monthly reports show a consistent increase in use even as we add more faculty members each month.</p>
