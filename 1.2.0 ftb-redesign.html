<!--Add in sectioning and linking within the page...this is a long one-->
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>One component of my role at the Academy is developing a design system for products like the Faculty Toolbox.
The Faculty Toolbox is a website housed within the US Air Force Academy's learning management system (LMS).
This site is intended to provide faculty with resources to effectively use the LMS for their courses.
It was apparent that design thinking had not been used to build the Toolbox.
Because of that, the Toolbox was not achieving its goal.
My challenge, then, was adapting design thinking to fit the unique needs and constraints of the Academy, and then applying that system to redesign the Toolbox.
</p>

<p>Drawing on my experience as a faculty member and online course designer, I was able to quickly spot problems with the Toolbox's information architecture, content, and lack of style guidelines.
  Since my role at the Academy serves all faculty, I knew I had to conduct user research to have a broader view of what would be useful for faculty, rather than relying just on my own experience.
  But, given the Academy is a government, military, and academic institution, there are constraints on how I am allowed to collect user research.
  Moreover, I had additional constraints since our team was brought in on a contract, and therefore had to heed the scope of the contract.
</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I was able to overcome these obstacles and redesign a website that better meets the needs of the faculty.
  We have seen continued growth in the number of faculty who have used the Toolbox, and the design system I implemented ensures that the Toolbox keeps up with the goals of the faculty.
</p>

<h2>User Research and Personas</h2>
<p>At the Academy, there is a lengthy process one has to complete to gain permission to officially survey faculty. 
  Because of that, I used the learning opportunities I was already offering as a way to conduct user research. 
  For online courses, this meant providing feedback opportunities (not surveys!) at the end of each course. 
  With face to face learning opportunities, I took time at the beginning and end of each session to informally interview attendees.
</p>

<p>One downside to conducting this type of user research is selection bias: because all learning opportunities are voluntary, I am only going to have the opportunity to gain feedback from faculty who are interested in, or use, the LMS. 
  In some ways this isn’t showstopper: currently use of the LMS is voluntary, so there isn’t much of a need to convert those who have no interest in using the LMS. 
  Noneless, using parts of the LMS will soon be mandatory, so I spoke with administrators in order to gain a more complete understanding of the different types of faculty, especially those opposed to using the LMS.
</p>

<p>From this research I found that there are 5 different types of faculty members at the Academy, each of which I captured in a persona. 
  If you would like to see each persona in full, click the name of the persona. 
  Alternately, you can view all of them in one document by opening this document: <a href=/toolbox-personas>Faculty Toolbox Personas document</a>. 
  Otherwise, here’s a quick summary of each persona and their needs and goals:
<ul>
  <li><a href=/eager-evan>Eager Evan</a>: Excited to use the LMS but lacks teaching experience, and isn’t aware of (or, sometimes, concerned with) how to implement the LMS in pedagogically effective ways. Evan needs “bite sized” instructions for using the LMS that have good pedagogy built in. </li>
  <li><a href=/veteran-victoria>Veteran Victoria</a>: Happy to use technology, but admits that she is “too old” to learn new technology like an LMS quickly. She needs how to guides that present information in small but detailed steps, and she needs ample opportunities to practice. </li>
  <li><a href=/all-in-ann>All-In Ann</a>: An early adopter of the LMS who has a “hands on” approach to trying new tools. She prefers face-to-face conversations when workshopping ideas and only needs an online resource when she is stuck, looking for new ideas, or searching for the basic instructions.  </li>
  <li><a href=/hesitant-harry>Hesitant Harry</a>: Self-labeled as more a researcher than a teacher, he believes that teaching already takes up too much time–-and learning an LMS will only take up more time that he could spend teaching. He needs to see that the LMS is easy to use and can save him time on activities like distributing readings and grading. </li>
  <li><a href=/old-school-ollie>Old-School Ollie</a>: Opposed to using the LMS because he sees it as a fad and believes his teaching methods are tried-and-true. Ollie doesn’t realize that he already uses technology similar to the LMS for his course, though he categorizes the LMS and the technology he uses differently. He needs to see that the LMS is, in some respects, just a different tool to accomplish the jobs he already does. </li>
</ul>
Common to all personas was a desire for information to be easy to find and the navigation to be “intuitive”. 
In this case, an “intuitive” navigation is one which maps a three-component mental model faculty have for building a course: course content and delivery, course administration, and assessment.
</p>

<h2>Retooling the Toolbox</h2>
<p>After building these personas, I turned my attention to the Toolbox. I started by looking at what had been built before I arrived at the Academy. Guided by the personas and my experience developing online courses, it was apparent that the Toolbox needed a redesign. The problems that stood out to me were:
  <ol type=1>
    <li> Site navigation that was not “intuitive” because it did not reflect the mental model faculty have for course building.</li>
    <li> Content that was not catered to the needs of the faculty at USAFA.</li>
    <li> No consistent use of fonts, headings, and colors to visually organize site content.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<!--  
<h2>Phase I: First Aid</h2>
<p>During my onboarding at the Academy, I was told about the Faculty Toolbox and given some extant user research on the faculty.
I was told that the goal of the Toolbox is the provide a resource for <i>all</i> faculty to learn about the LMS.
The available user research was quite limited: the faculty at the Academy were all over the map with respect to technological ability and willingness to adopt the LMS.
Some faculty were eager to use the LMS unsure of how to do so. 
Others, regardless of technological ability, were adamantly opposed to using it.
And there were a few who were already power users of the LMS.
</p>

<h3>Problem Spotting</h3>
  <p>Even with limited user research, it was easy to find ways to improve the Toolbox.
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox.PNG" alt="Original Faculty Toolbox landing page." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto">
  <p>After looking through the Toolbox, I identified three pain points based on the research available and my own experience as a faculty member:
    <ul>
      <li>Unclear labels: The main menu for the website did not clearly indicate what kind of content was available on each page. This is a problem, because it meant that a faculty member would need to click around a lot on the site in search of content, rather than knowing where to look after opening the site.</li>
      <li>Missing information: But, unfortunately, all of that clicking did not guarantee that they would find what they were looking for. Taking into account my own experience, as well as the varied levels of knowledge of the LMS, it was apparent that the Toolbox was missing important information on how to build and maintain a course within the LMS.</li>
      <li>Inconsistent style: It was apparent that the site was put together in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner because of the inconsistent style. For instance, there was no clear use of headers and colors to distinguish types of content.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
<p>After identifying these problems, it was time to fix them. The strategy I employed started with the site's information architecture.
  By redesigning the information architecture I would be able to categorize information in a better way&mdash;thereby helping solve the unclear labels problem&mdash;and more easily see what information was missing&mdash;thus making inroads on the missing information problem.
  Moreover, a clear plan for where to place content would provide some direction for developing a style guide later on.
</p>
-->
<h3>Site Navigation</h3>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>My guiding principle when redesigning the Toolbox's navigation was this: <i>If you want faculty to learn and adopt a new tool like the LMS, you need a resource center that makes sense to them, that demonstrates the capabilities of the tool while providing information within a framework they understand and already use to build their courses.</i> While a course is presented as a whole, faculty often use a three-part mental model for constructing and thinking about their course: course content and delivery, course administration, and assessment. The problem with the top-level architecture of the orginial site (pictured below) was that it did not do this.
<br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox-Menu1.png" alt="Original Faculty Toolbox navigation menu."><br>
As you can see, the top level navigation has a generic "Inside Your Course" menu item. This wouldn't be too bad, except the "Inside Your Course" page didn't reflect the mental model, as demonstrated by the following screenshot.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FTB-InsideYourCourse.PNG" alt="Inside Your Course page."><br>
As you can see, the "Inside Your Course" page was missing both headers to distinguish types of content based on the mental model as well as content for each piece of the model. Section Enrollment deals with course administration, while rubrics deal with assessment&mdash;but there is nothing on building and delivering content. Moreover, the "Ask a Librarian" link is out of place. So, the original site navigation didn't reflect the mental model faculty use, which made the site less "intuitive".
</p>

<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>The obvious starting point, then, was to redesign the site navigation and menu around the mental model faculty use when designing their courses. To make information easy to find, it made sense to have the top-level navigation for content reflect the three components of the course building mental model. With that in mind, I sketched out prototypes for the top-level architecture and some secondary architecture.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype1.png" alt="Menu prototype number 1."><br>
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype2.png" alt="Menu prototype number 2."><br>
After showing these ideas to my team and some faculty, it was clear that I was on the right track. So, after a little more tweaking, the Faculty Resources portion of the course menu was finished.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuFinal.png" alt="The final version of the Faculty Resources portion of the site menu.">
</p>

<p>Along with categories that reflect the course building mental model, one advantage of this way of organizing site content is that it takes advantage of the user interface to provide a snapshot of the LMS's capabilities. For instance, Eager Evan opens the "Building Your Course" page, he is shown what capabilities the LMS has for course building. In the case of the following screenshot, he would immediately know that the LMS has tools for teaching, the ability to add videos, and the ability to release content as I see fit. (Don't worry, we'll talk more about the specific content planned for the Toolbox in the next!)
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-ContentArea1-List.png" alt="Building Your Course content."><br>
This is a great feature for all users. All-in Ann, for example, would be able to quickly see whether the LMS has the capabilities she is looking for. Likewise, when Veteran Victoria is searching for instructions on using the LMS's grading capabilities, she will be able to spot a link to those instructions, rather than having to scroll through what she perceives as unnecessary content. On the other end of the spectrum, someone like Hesitant Harry might be surprised at what the LMS can do and decide to learn more about it (and, hopefully, decide to then use it). And, if Old-School Ollie decided to take a look at the Toolbox, he may learn that the LMS has tools to do a lot of the tasks he already does for course administration.
</p>
  

<h3>Catered Content</h3>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>As pointed out above, the original Toolbox contained some resources for using Blackboard but was missing some key pieces of content.
 <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Faculty resources from original toolbox."><br>
The resources listed in the screenshot (managing section enrollment, Safe Assign, course evaluations, library resources, publisher information, rubric resources, and adding scrollbars on a Mac) are good resources for faculty&mdash;who are already familiar with and want to use the LMS.  But the original Toolbox did not cater to the needs of those with little technological ability such as Veteran Victoria. Nor did the original Toolbox try to convince those opposed to adopting the LMS (Hesitant Harry or Old-School Ollie) to give it a try, by, for instance, talking about how some of the tools are easy to use and can save a lot of time. (If you're curious about just how much time some of these tools can save, check out my other portfolio item on using <a href=/cw-assessment>digital rubrics</a>.) And even for those who have experience using an LMS (All-in Ann) or are just excited to adopt the LMS (Eager Evan), the available content didn't provide a good overview of what the LMS is capable of.
</p>

<p>Creating distinct nodes in the site navigation for course building, course administration, and assessment helped make the navigation more intuitive&mdash;it also made it easy to see what content was missing for the different types of faculty. For instance, there was not a content item that provided a high-level overview of common teaching tools. Such an overview would be beneficial for those with little to no knowledge of the LMS because it would provide a starting point for learning more about the LMS. But this type of overview could also be used to communicate the time-saving component of using the LMS to those faculty who were opposed to, or skeptical of, adopting it. So, the redesigned solved one problem and revealed the extent of another.
</p> 

<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>Because the Toolbox was live and used by some faculty, I couldn't take the site down while rebuilding it. So I adopted a three stage approach to updating the content on the Toolbox:
  <ol type=1>
    <li> Organize existing content in accordance with the new site map.</li>
    <li> Add priority content.</li>
    <li> Develop and implement a content roadmap, to include both the templates for content and the topics themselves.</li>
  </ol>
The first two stages were, essentially, first aid. After updating the site map, I needed to make sure that the content already available was correctly categorized. This involved, for instance, nesting the information on rubrics underneath Assessment and Feedback. The priority content was content that needed to be added as soon as possible due to a number of changes to the LMS and the Academy's policies on using it that occurred between the time the Toolbox was built and my first few months.   
</p>

<p>With all of that completed, I turned my attention to the long-term development and sustainment of the Faculty Toolbox. To design a product that faculty would use and enjoy, I had to think about both what content to add to the Toolbox and how to present that content. As an LMS subject matter expert, coming up with topics for content was not difficult, so it was tempting to start with a list of topics and start developing those pages. But there were two considerations that kept me from pursuing that place. First, I recgonized that faculty would appreciate and benefit from a consistent presentation of content. Second, most of the content that I could develop quickly would be "how-to" guides&mdash;and those already existed on help pages for the LMS.
</p>

<p>These considertations led to me to first focus on developing content templates. By developing and using templates, I would be able to:
  <ul>
    <li> Provide a consistent experience for faculty;</li>
    <li> Ensure that the copy addressed the needs of the faculty through the design of the template;</li>
    <li> Make it possible to outsource the "how to" guides by linking to the LMS help site; and</li>
    <li> Speed up the copy writing process (which is helpful, since I am a one-man shop).</li>
  </ul>
With that decision made, I went back to the personas to guide the design of the Toolbox templates.
</p>

<p>I started developing templates for the Toolbox by sketching.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-TemplatePrototypes-01.png" alt="Initial sketches and comments on template prototype"><br>
After producing the initial sketch, I started marking it up with ideas for how to improve it, as well as noting areas in which it was deficient. I pretty quickly realized that one template would be insufficient for all the topics I would likely develop. Someone like All-in Ann, for instance, might want to know the differences between two tools, whereas as a more straightforward tutorial would be better for Hesitant Harry or Veterean Victoria. So, I sketched out a few more template possibilities: initially one for tutorials and two for comparisons.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-TemplatePrototypes-02.png" alt="Sketches for a tutorial template and comparison templates."><br>
While one of the templates for comparing tools could have provided for a neat visual display, ultiamtely I decided to keep the format for the tutorial and comparison templates as similar as I could. So, I was left with two sketches for templates from which I would build working prototypes for testing.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-TemplatePrototypes-03.png" alt="Sketches for a tutorial template and comparison templates.">
</p>
  
<p>To test these prototypes, I adapted content from priority content. This would allow those helping me test these templates to not only see what the templates looked like, but would also provide the opportunity to do some A/B testing. First up is the working prototype for the tutorial template.
 <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-TutorialTemplate.png" alt="Sketches for a tutorial template and comparison templates."><br>
And here we have the comparison template.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-ComparisonTemplate.png" alt="Sketches for a tutorial template and comparison templates."><br>
</p>
Notice the consistency: a three-section format where the first introduces the tool or tools, the second provides examples, and the third includes links to the "how-to" guides.

<p>These templates are just the start of the long-term development and sustainment of the Toolbox. As alluded to above, I am a one-man shop at the Academy for LMS training. Consequently, I have yet to fully test these templates. I am also still in the process of using the personas to develop a list of topics for the Toolbox. (Which may be for the best: now that the LMS has a known presence at the Academy, I am observing a sixth type of faculty member. More on that below in the Outcomes section.)
</p>

<h3>Style Guide</h3>
<!--Style guide: mention how you want colors to distinguish types of content, which is not the case if you organize the site another way: it circles back to the "IA first" approach.-->
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>While faculty did not explicitly talk about the appearance of the Toolbox, my experience designing and teaching online courses made it hard to ignore the inconsistent and sometimes unhelpful formatting used when the Toolbox was built. Consider, for instance, the original "Inside Your Course" page:   
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Different fonts and content type."><br>
Here the bottom item is different from the preceding ones in two respects. First, the font is not the same as the others. Second, whereas the first three items are links to content, the fourth just is the content.
</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the original Toolbox, the formatting seemed to lack a clear purpose and/or was unhelpful. For example, the highlighting in the welcome message does not provide much of a contrast to the background.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox-Welcome.png" alt="Lack of contrast between the background and the highlight."><br>
  It's unclear what that highlighting is supposed to communicate, if it was even intentional.
</p>

<p>Finally, the alternating color of the titles for Workshop presentations seems to only highlight that the content items are distinct.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea3.PNG" alt="Different colors for the titles of content items."><br>
Because there are line breaks and icons that do this, the color coding doesn't serve much of a purpose. In fact, it might be confusing: since the different items are already clearly delineated, one might come to believe the colors distinguish the content in some other way. If the colors had been used to group content&mdash;one color for assessment-related presentations, another for communication-related presentations, etc.&mdash;then there would be a good reason to use different colors. (Though in that case, similar types of content should have been placed next to one another as well.)
</p>

<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>These formatting issues were easy to fix. For instance, using highlighting to emphasize important information such as warngings, known issues, and system downtime. Using a consistent font across all content is easy as well, since the built-in text editor for the LMS has a default font (and style guide). Finally, I decided to implement the following guidelines for color coding:
  <ul>
    <li>Black font for content.</li>
    <li>Blue (#0000FF) font for in-page headers to help further organize content (such as when a list of quizzes begins).</li>
    <li>Dark Cyan-Azure (#0099CC) for quizzes.</li>
  </ul>
In the case of the Building Your Course page, the end result looks like this:
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Building Your Course page."><br>
</p>

<!--
<h4>Phase I Outcomes</h4>
<p>The first phase of redesigning and rebranding focused on first aid. Using extant user research, I quickly found that the Toolbox, as it was created, was not meeting the needs of all faculty. The three main problems were unclear labels, missing information, and inconsistent style. To fix these problems I redesigned the information architecture, drafted a preliminary content roadmap, and implemented a style guide. These actions laid a foundation on which I could rebrand the Toolbox and better leverage its capabilities to provide a hub for LMS news, knowledge, and community.
</p>

<h2>Phase II: Rebrand and Enhance</h2>
<p>To really turn the Toolbox into a resource for all faculty, I needed to do more than perform some first aid to the site.
  With encouragement from the leadership at the Academy, I began collaborating with the Center for Educational Innovation (CEI) to continue developing the toolbox.
  The first step in this endeavor was to do a more thorough job understanding the faculty. 
  Working with the CEI, I conducted more user research and, along with the research I had already been given, developed three personas to guide the design process for Phase II.
  From these personas I was able to identify pain points unique to different types of faculty, as well as ones common to all.
  I then began to ideate, prototype, and test solutions to these pain points.
  Realizing that this would be a continual process, I also began to develop a design system for the Toolbox.
</p>

<h3>Persona "Deep Dive"</h3>
In my position as the LMS Training Lead, I was able to informally interview a number of faculty about their experience with the LMS.
From these interviews, I developed three personas that captured the spectrum of experiences I encountered.
These heart of these personas is not much different from what was outlined above:
some faculty are opposed to or skeptical of using the LMS to teach, some are interested in using the LMS but do not know where to start, and a smaller number are power users of the LMS.
</p>

<h4>Persona 1 GIVE A NAME</h4>

<h4>Persona 2 GIVE A NAME</h4>

<h4>Persona 3 GIVE A NAME</h4>

<p> Basically, a summary of how I develop things now: look at the data, interview faculty, empathize, define, ideate, prototype, testing and implementing are concurrent and the data and interviews help assess it.

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The Toolbox is very much a living product. The initial style guide and first-aid are completed phases of the website, but the Toolbox will continue to be developed. Even so, there are some concrete outcomes of this project to date:
  <ul>
    <li>150 faculty have started using the Toolbox since the initial redesign. That's a 27% increase in Toolbox usage by faculty. Overall, we have estimated that over 50% of faculty have used the Toolbox and voluntarily adopted Blackboard, which is a huge win since the LMS was brought on less than two years ago and has had some very vocal critics.</li>
    <li>We consistently observed increased usage of the Toolbox, which serves as a proxy for increased use of the LMS. The percentage of enrolled users in the Toolbox continues to increase even as we add new faculty. Last year over 37% of enrolled users had accessed the Toolbox; as of December nearly 42% of enrolled users had access the Toolbox&mdash;and that's with adding 66 new users to the Toolbox. 
    <li>The implementation of design thinking in LMS-related training at the Academy.</li>
    <li>A consistent user experience across the Faculty Toolbox website.</li>
  </ul>
As the Toolbox is developed I will update this page to reflect the outcomes of testing and further developments on content for the website. For instance, now that the LMS has been in use for nearly two years, I am noticing a sixth type of faculty: the educator who wants to use the LMS to improve the quality of education but doesn't know much about the system. One of the next tasks for developing the Toolbox is to conduct more user research, construct a persona for this type of faculty, and make sure that their needs are being met.
</p>
