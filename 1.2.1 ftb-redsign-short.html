<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p><u>Background</u>: The Faculty Toolbox was created as a resource for faculty to learn about the US Air Force Academy's Learning Management System (LMS). When I started my current role I took over the development of the Toolbox. There were several usability problems that were apparent from day one.</p>

<p><u>Goal</u>: Redesign and rebrand the Faculty Toolbox to increase usability and traffic to the site.</p>

<p><u>My Role</u>: Website Designer, User Researcher, Information Architect</p>

<h2>The Design Process</h2>
<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>I combined my experience as a faculty member and instructional designer along with informal interviews to create personas for the 5 different types of faculty I discovered during my research. 
<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQQojCNcy7bVGM3VZEIszkn1-W4So6RxpEDPbI-lZTvincEJtNEuliuof_VzvISeZH-QAvnroc8SJLu/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
</div>
Common to all personas was a desire for information to be easy to find and the navigation to be “intuitive”. In this case, an “intuitive” navigation is one which maps a three-component mental model faculty have for building a course: course content and delivery, course administration, and assessment.
</p>


<h3>UX Methods</h3>
Along with user research, the main UX skills used in this project were:
<ul>
  <li><u>Information Architecture</u>: The original site navigation did not reflect the mental model faculty use for building courses, so I redesigned the site navigation and link names to reflect that model.</li>
  <li><u>Sketching and Wireframing</u>: Creating content templates required ideating, and then sketching and wireframing, solutions for presenting content to faculty.</li>
  <li><u>UI Style Guide</u>: The headers and fonts varied from page to page in the original Toolbox, so I created a style guide to standardize the look and feel of the site.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Design Decisions</h3>
<p>Guided by the personas, I identified three problems with Toolbox as it waws created: 
<ol type=1>
    <li> Site navigation that was not “intuitive” because it did not reflect the mental model faculty have for course building.</li>
    <li> Content was not catered to the needs of the faculty at USAFA.</li>
    <li> No consistent use of fonts, headings, and colors to visually organize site content.</li>
</ol></p>

<h4>Site Navigation</h4>
<p>The original site navigation did not reflect the mental model faculty use for building their courses. 
<br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox-Menu1.png" alt="Original Faculty Toolbox navigation menu."><br>
For instance, "Inside Your Course" was too broad a label, and even when I opended it content wasn't organized according the mental model.
<br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FTB-InsideYourCourse.PNG" alt="Inside Your Course page."><br>
</p>

<p>To remedy this, I sketched out prototypes for the top-level architecture and some secondary architecture.
  <div id="ArchSketch" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
    <!-- Indicators -->
    <ol class="carousel-indicators">
      <li data-target="#ArchSketch" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
      <li data-target="#ArchSketch" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Wrapper for slides -->
    <div class="carousel-inner">
      <div class="item active">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype1.png" alt="Menu sketch number 1.">
      	</div>

      <div class="item">
        <img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype2.png" alt="Menu sketch number 2.">
      </div>

    <!-- Left and right controls -->
    <a class="left carousel-control" href="#ArchSketch" data-slide="prev">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></span>
      <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
    </a>
    <a class="right carousel-control" href="#ArchSketch" data-slide="next">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span>
      <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
    </a>
  </div>
 <!-- <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype1.png" alt="Menu prototype number 1."><br>
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype2.png" alt="Menu prototype number 2."><br>-->
After showing these ideas to my team and some faculty, it was clear that I was on the right track. So, after a little more tweaking, the Faculty Resources portion of the course menu was finished.
  <br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-MenuFinal.png" alt="The final version of the Faculty Resources portion of the site menu.">
</p>

<p>A big advantage of using this site navigation is that it also previews the LMS's capabilities when I open a page, such as "Building Your Course".
<br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/FTB-ContentArea1-List.png" alt="Building Your Course content."></p>

<h4>Catered Content</h4>
<p>After restructuring the site navigation, I developed a three-stage approach to dealing with missing and misorganized content:
<ol type=1>
    <li> Organize existing content in accordance with the new site map.</li>
    <li> Add priority content.</li>
    <li> Develop and implement a content roadmap, to include both the templates for content and the topics themselves.</li>
  </ol>
The first two stages were, essentially, first aid. For instance, moving "Adding scrollbars to Grade Center on Macs" out of "Inside Your Course" and into "Additional Resources".
<br><img class="img-responsive" src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Faculty resources from original toolbox."></p>

<p>For the third stage, I started with content templates because it would allow me to:
  <ul>
    <li> Provide a consistent experience for faculty;</li>
    <li> Ensure that the copy addressed the needs of the faculty through the design of the template;</li>
    <li> Make it possible to outsource the "how to" guides by linking to the LMS help site; and</li>
    <li> Speed up the copy writing process (which is helpful, since I am a one-man shop).</li>
  </ul>
I quickly went from sketches of a few possibilities down to two different content templates, and developed two prototypes.

<h4>Style Guide</h4>
<p>The style across the original Toolbox was inconsistent.

To provide a consistent user experience, I created a style guide for the Toolbox. To keep things simple, I stuck with the defaults in the LMS's text-editor for things such as font. I also added the following rules such as:
  <ul>
    <li>Black font for content.</li>
    <li>Blue (#0000FF) font for in-page headers to help further organize content (such as when a list of quizzes begins).</li>
    <li>Dark Cyan-Azure (#0099CC) for quizzes.</li>
    <li>Use highlighting to emphasize important information such as warngings, known issues, and system downtime.</li>
  </ul>
These rules provided a consistent user experience and helped visually chunk content on a page.
