<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p><u>Background</u>: The Faculty Toolbox was created as a resource for faculty to learn about the US Air Force Academy's Learning Management System (LMS). When I started my current role I took over the development of the Toolbox. There were several usability problems that were apparent from day one.</p>

<p><u>Goal</u>: Redesign and rebrand the Faculty Toolbox to increase usability and traffic to the site.</p>

<p><u>My Role</u>: Website Designer, User Researcher, Information Architect</p>

<h2>The Design Process</h2>
<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>I combined my experience as a faculty member along with informal interviews to create personas for the 5 different types of faculty I discovered during my research.

<!--If you would like to see each persona in full, click the name of the persona. Alternately, you can view all of them in one document by opening this <a href=/toolbox-personas>Faculty Toolbox Personas document</a>. Otherwise, here’s a quick summary of each persona and their needs and goals:
<ul>
  <li><a href=/eager-evan>Eager Evan</a>: Excited to use the LMS but lacks teaching experience, and isn’t aware of (or, sometimes, concerned with) how to implement the LMS in pedagogically effective ways. Evan needs “bite sized” instructions for using the LMS that have good pedagogy built in. </li>
  <li><a href=/veteran-victoria>Veteran Victoria</a>: Happy to use technology, but admits that she is “too old” to learn new technology like an LMS quickly. She needs how to guides that present information in small but detailed steps, and she needs ample opportunities to practice. </li>
  <li><a href=/all-in-ann>All-In Ann</a>: An early adopter of the LMS who has a “hands on” approach to trying new tools. She prefers face-to-face conversations when workshopping ideas and only needs an online resource when she is stuck, looking for new ideas, or searching for the basic "how to" instructions.  </li>
  <li><a href=/hesitant-harry>Hesitant Harry</a>: Self-labeled as more a researcher than a teacher, he believes that teaching already takes up too much time&mdash;and learning an LMS will only take up more time that he could spend teaching. He needs to see that the LMS is easy to use and can save him time on activities like distributing readings and grading. </li>
  <li><a href=/old-school-ollie>Old-School Ollie</a>: Opposed to using the LMS because he sees it as a fad and believes his teaching methods are tried-and-true. Ollie doesn’t realize that he already uses technology similar to the LMS for his course, though he categorizes the LMS and the technology he uses differently. He needs to see that the LMS is, in some respects, just a different tool to accomplish the jobs he already does. </li>
</ul>-->
Common to all personas was a desire for information to be easy to find and the navigation to be “intuitive”. 
In this case, an “intuitive” navigation is one which maps a three-component mental model faculty have for building a course: course content and delivery, course administration, and assessment.
