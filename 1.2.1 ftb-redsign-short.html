<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p><u>Background</u>: The Faculty Toolbox was created as a resource for faculty to learn about the US Air Force Academy's Learning Management System (LMS). When I started my current role I took over the development of the Toolbox. There were several usability problems that were apparent from day one.</p>

<p><u>Goal</u>: Redesign and rebrand the Faculty Toolbox to increase usability and traffic to the site.</p>

<p><u>My Role</u>: Website Designer, User Researcher, Information Architect</p>

<h2>The Design Process</h2>
<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>I combined my experience as a faculty member along with informal interviews to create personas for the 5 different types of faculty I discovered during my research.

</div>
Common to all personas was a desire for information to be easy to find and the navigation to be “intuitive”. 
In this case, an “intuitive” navigation is one which maps a three-component mental model faculty have for building a course: course content and delivery, course administration, and assessment.
