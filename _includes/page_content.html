                <p> Currently I am the LMS training lead at the United States Air Force Academy. My primary role there
                        is to instruct faculty on how to use Blackboard, the learning management system (LMS), to improve the delivery of their course content.
                </p>
                        
                <p> At Northwest Vista College I regularly taught Intro to Philosophy, Intro to Logic, and Intro to Ethics.
                On my <a href=/teaching.html>teaching page</a> you will find links to the past syllabi for those courses.
                </p>

                <p> While a graduate student at Baylor, I taught several honors colloquia for the Honors College.
                My teaching page includes descriptions for these colloquiua.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
                <br/>
                <p> My main research projects are in metaphysics and the philosohpy of religion. 
                I have interests in both virtue ethics and environmental ethics, and I also dabble in more formal work.
                My <a href=/research.html>research page</a> contains more information on these projects, including drafts of papers as well as abstracts for works in progress and published work.
                </p>
                      
                <p> Along with my academic interests in philosophy of religion, I am also working on a book for a more general audience that explores what it means to hear God's voice and explain why we 
                        sometimes seem to have difficulty hearing it.
