              <h2>About Daniel Padgett</h2>
              <br/>
                <p> Welcome! I am the Blackboard training lead at the United States Air Force Academy.  
                I received my PhD in Philosophy from Baylor University in August 2016. My dissertation defended a relational view
                of time. (More details are available on my <a href=/research>research page</a>.) Alexander R. Pruss directed my dissertation.
                <p>If you'd like to know more about what I do outside of teaching faculty about Blackboard and thinking about philosophy, you can click <a href=/about.html>here</a>. </p>
