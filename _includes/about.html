              <h2>About Me</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>Hi! I'm Dan, and I want to make your life better. Historically, I've helped people through teaching and instructional design.
                    Recently, though, I've expanded my design skills to User Experience (UX) design more generally. 
                    Currently I am the LMS Training Lead at the US Air Force Academy. In this role I focus on helping faculty create
                    learner-centered experiences using the Academy's LMS. I also lead special projects where I design products to help meet the 
                    mission of the Academy. 
                    If you'd like to see some of those projects, please check out my <a href=/design-projects>Design Projects</a> page. </p>
                <br>
                <p>My academic background is in Math and Philosopy, and I hold a PhD in Philosophy.
                Along with allowing me to read, think, and <a href=/research>write</a> about some really cool topics, 
                Philosophy has helped hone the skills I will employ to design useful solutions for you by:
                <ul>
                    <li> Developing my ability to understand information systematically and organize it in intuitive, coherent ways; </li>
                    <li> Teaching me how to ask insightful questions that reveal assumptions, motivations, and pain points;</li>
                    <li> Providing plenty of opportunities to think creatively and outside the box; and</li>
                    <li> Encouraging my desire to learn about, understand, and apply new concepts and ideas.</li>
                </ul> </p>
                <br>
                <p>As a teacher and instructional designer, these skills have been further refined and applied to interaction design.
                    To design learning experiences well, I have learned what makes for efficient, effective, and engaging interaction with a product.
                    And, since learning experiences can always be improved, I've become an expert at seeking feedback from users and iterating based on that feedback.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Simply put: I want to figure out and articulate what would make your life better, and come up with a creative solution to do just that.</p>

<!-- Welcome! I am the LMS training lead at the United States Air Force Academy.  
               I received my PhD in Philosophy from Baylor University in August 2016. My dissertation defended a relational view
                of time. (More details are available on my <a href=/research>research page</a>.) Alexander R. Pruss directed my dissertation.
                <p>If you'd like to know more about what I do outside of teaching faculty about Blackboard and thinking about philosophy, you can click <a href=/about.html>here</a>. </p>
