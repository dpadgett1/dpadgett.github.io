              <br/>
                <p> Welcome! I am a Philosophy instructor at Northwest Vista College in San Antonio, TX.  
                I received my PhD in Philosophy from Baylor University in August 2016. My dissertation defended a relational view
                of time. (More details are available on my research page.) Alexander Pruss directed my dissertation.
