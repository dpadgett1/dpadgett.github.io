<h2><a href=/cw-assessment>Saving Time With User-Centered Design</a></h2>
<p> By applying agile design principles, I digitized two components of an annual assessment cycle at the US Air Force Academy. 
The final product from this project consisted of a collection of websites and rubrics built in the Academy’s learning management system 
that was easy to use, met the leadership’s requirements, and saved Academy staff 915 hours of work per assessment cycle.</p>
