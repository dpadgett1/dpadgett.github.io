<p>For your convenience, I've listed my professional accomplishments in two different formats. If you're interested in an exhausted list of what I've done professionally and academically, please take a look at my <a href=/cv>CV</a>. If you're more interested in a shorter presentation of my skills and abilities as a UX designer, then please check out my <a href=/resume>resume&#769;</a>. If neither of those have what your are looking for, please <a href=/contact>contact me</a>.
