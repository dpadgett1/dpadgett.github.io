<p>For your convenience, I've listed my professional accomplishments in two different formats. If you're interested in a shorter presentation of my skills and abilities as a UX designer, please check out my resume&#769. If you'd prefer to see an exhaustive list of what I've done professionally and academically, please take a look at my CV. If neither of those have what your are looking for, please <a href=/contact>contact me</a>.
