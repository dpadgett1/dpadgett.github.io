<p>My main research projects are in metaphysics and the philosohpy of religion. 
I have interests in both virtue ethics and environmental ethics, and I also dabble in more formal work.
On this page you will find information about (and in some cases drafts of papers for) past, present, and future work.

<h2>Dissertation</h2>
<i>A Relational View of Time</i>, directed by Alexander R. Pruss
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><i>Abstract</i>: In my dissertation I defend a relational view of time. The relationalist claims that time exists, but that time's existence is ontologically dependent on changing things. So, contra the current orthodoxy, neither time nor spacetime are fundamental entities. I defend this view within an Aristotelian ontology. This ontology is hierarchical: there are fundamental entities and there are non-fundamental entities, where every non-fundamental entity is grounded in or derived from the fundamental entities. Part of my dissertation says what it means for a non-fundamental entity to be derived from fundamental entities. After offering the relevant details of an Aristotelian ontology, I show how one can derive time from substances that change. I spend the final chapters showing the advantages of my version of relationalism over others, and arguing against substantivalism, especially the versions espoused by Theodore Sider and Jonathan Schaffer.

<h2>Works in Progress</h2>
"Ontological Pluralism and Abstraction"
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><i>Abstract</i>: An Aristotelian ontology consists of fundamental entities and derivative entities. The fundamental and the derivative are related by the grounding relation. There has been much discussion on what properties the grounding relation has. But the discussion has not focused on the connection between whether there is one grounding relation and whether ontological monism is true. In this paper I argue that the substance pluralist should hold that there are two kinds of grounding relations, abstraction and construction. I then offer semantics for both relations and suggest that construction offers an easy way out of the problem of the lump and the statue.

"The Ersatz Thin Red Line"
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><i>Abstract</i>: It seems that fore-truth and free action compatible. For tomorrow I will decide whether to run or cycle, and I am free to do either action. But it's also true that, were I to make such a decision, I'd go cycling; and this is true temporally prior to my decision. So it seems that the following three theses are true: (i) there are free actions, (ii) there are truths about what a free agent would do in certain circumstances, and (iii) these truths are true temporally prior to the agent's action. Call the conjunction of (i)--(iii) the Fore-truth and Indeterminism Theory (FIT). Certain theistic theses, such as Molinism, require FIT. But Belnap and Green, and, more recently, Greg Restall have argued that one way of modeling FIT is semantically and metaphysically deficient. This view employs branching time&mdash:which is a way of modeling indeterminism (including the indeterminism required for free action)&mdash;and a thin red line (TRL)&mdash;which captures the truth that I would go cycling were I to go running or cycling. I argue that the semantic and metaphysical worries raised by Belnap and Green and Restall are unfounded: there's nothing about branching time per se that poses a problem for FIT: whatever problems arise for FIT arise independently of branching time + TRL. There's a simple, intuitive way to deal with the apparent semantic inconsistency and a plausible metaphysic for the semantics that allows for both indeterminism and a TRL. That there is such a metaphysic is evidence that freedom and fore-truth (and hence foreknowledge) are compatible.

"Updating With The Theory Theory Of Conditionals"
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><i>Abstract</i>: When updating on a conditional, we can either preserve the probability of the antecedent of that conditional or not. Currently there is no consensus on when we should preserve the probability of the antecedent (in part because the question has received little attention). I offer a schema for deciding whether to preserve the probability of the antecedent that unifies the intuitions guiding the competing views currently on offer.

<a href=http://dx.doi.org/10.11612/resphil.2014.91.3.12>"Reconstituting Ersatzer Presentism"</a> (with T. Ryan Byerly), Res Philosophica,  July 2014.
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><i>Abstract</i>: Presentists claim that only presently existing objects exist. One version of presentism is ersatzer presentism, according to which times are a kind of abstract object. Such a view is appealing because it affords the presentist an answer to the grounding objection&mdash;a potentially lethal objection to presentism. Despite this advantage, available versions of ersatzer presentism suffer from a heretofore unappreciated shortcoming: they cannot account for the truth of certain counterfactual claims about the past. We argue for this claim by considering two views representative of ersatzer presentism&mdash;those of Thomas Crisp and Craig Bourne. After presenting our arguments against their views, we defend two crucial assumptions in those arguments. Finally, we offer a novel version of ersatzer presentism that appropriates the metaphysics of constitution in order to avoid the difficulty that current ersatzer presentist views face.
