   <p> I have been teaching Intro to Ethics and Intro to Logic at Northwest Vista College. I am scheduled to teach those courses again in the Spring, as well as a section of Introduction to Philosophy. A copy of the syllabi for Ethics and Logic can be found on this page. (Note: dates on the syllabi are for the Fall 2015 courses.)
  
  <p> Baylor Honors Colloq.
