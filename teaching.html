At Northwest Vista College I regularly teach Introduction to Philosohpy, Introduction to Ethics, and Introduction to Logic.
The syllabi for the current version of those courses can be found on this page.

While a graduate student at Baylor University, I taught several Honors Colloquia for the Honors College. These colloquia were
one-time, three hour classes on a topic of my choosing. Descriptions of the colloquia are below:
   <br>
   <br> 
    <i>Seeing Truth and Paradox </I>Through The Looking-Glass (Fall 2012)<p>
   <ul style="list-style: none;"><li> Lewis Carroll is known for creating fantastic worlds where nonsense seems to be normal. But through the events that take place and through the characters we meet in these worlds, Carroll raises important questions about language and reality--some of which lead to surprising results. We'll look at some of the more puzzling aspects of language and reality that arise when we follow Alice through the looking-glass.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <i>Freedom and Foreknowledge or Freedom Versus Foreknowledge</i> (Spring 2013)<p>
    <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>Theists often assert both (i) that humans have free will and (ii) that God is omniscient. The latter claim is often taken to include knowledge of future contingent events. We will examine several views of divine foreknowledge and discuss whether the theist can hold both (i) and (ii) or must choose between them. Specifically, we will be concerned with whether (and how) we can have free will in light of God’s omniscience.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <i>Making Space For Time</i> (Fall 2013)<p>
    <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>We often sacrifice time for the sake of space: we work longer hours to buy more things or to live in a larger place. But why do we prioritize space? Is there a reason to think that space is more valuable than time? We will examine one author who thinks not. Our discussion will start by examining Heschel’s arguments for thinking that one should see time as holy, not space. We will pay special attention to his reasons for maintaining the Sabbath. Time permitting, we’ll think about how to live in a way that sees time as more valuable than space.
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <i>What Is A Community</i> (Spring 2014)<p>
    <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>One of the questions raised in Wendell Berry’s <i>Sex, Economy, Freedom, &amp; Community</i> is what it means to live in a community. Berry answers this question through a collection of essays. We will discuss Berry’s idea of what a community is, what it means to be a part of such a community, and how a community relates to the land around it and the people outside of it. We will conclude by thinking about whether and how we can create such a community at Baylor (or wherever we are).
   </ul>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <i>Cultivating Virtue</i> (Fall 2014)<p>
   <ul style="list-style: none;"><li> The back cover of The Great Divorce says that the book is about  "the ultimate consequences of everyday behavior." We will focus on the different characters that Lewis writes about in order to reflect upon the cultivation of virtue and vice. Our reflection will focus on Lewis’ view of humans and how it is possible to cultivate virtues and vices that have the ultimate consequences that Lewis claims they do.
    </ul>
