<h1>The Challenge</h1>
Each year, the Cadet Wing (CW) assesses the over 4000 cadets at the US Air Force Academy. 
Two components of this&ndash;the personal appearance inspection and cadet interview&ndash;had been carried out on paper or used a survey tool to log responses. 
This process required hundreds of hours of work to compile and analyze the data at the end of the assessment period, aside from the number of hours spent carrying out the inspections and interviews. 
With the recent acquisition of a Learning Management System (LMS), the CW wanted to utilize the LMS to save time and have all the data entered and stored in one location. 
They contacted our team, and I took the lead on this project, carrying out the design and development of the products, and providing training on how to use them. 
<h1>The Iterative Design Process</h1>

  <h2>Choosing the Right Rubric</h2>

  <h2>Assign Points</h2>

  <h2>Assigning a Grade</h2>

<h1>Outcome</h1>
<p>Once the design process was over, I trained over 80 people who would either use the rubrics or train others on how to use the rubrics. 
  The feedback we received at the end of the assessment period was overwhelmingly positive. 
  Among the positive feedback we received was a letter of commendation from the Vice Commandant of Cadets noting how <q>Dr. Padgettâ€™s innovative placement of the Personal Appearance Inspection (PAI) into Blackboard is a game changer for us</q>. 
  And the numbers do not lie about that: not only were the users happy with the experience provided by the rubrics, but overall these rubrics saved CW staff 915 hours of work (per assessment cycle)!</p>
