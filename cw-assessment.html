<h1>Saving Time with User-Centered Design</h1>
<p>My main research projects are in metaphysics and the philosohpy of religion. 
I have interests in both virtue ethics and environmental ethics, and I also dabble in more formal work.
On this page you will find information about (and in some cases drafts of papers for) past, present, and future work.
If you would like a draft of a paper that is not posted, please <a href=/contact>contact me</a>.
