title: Rebuilding And Rebranding The Faculty Toolbox

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The Faculty Toolbox is a website housed within the US Air Force Academy's learning management system (LMS).
This site is intended to provide faculty with resources to effectively use the LMS for their courses.
  When I started working at the Academy, I quickly realized that the Toolbox's organization was not conducive to that goal.
  So, I performed some first aid on the Toolbox: re-doing the information architecture, adding a table of contents, and developing and applying a style guide.
  Even with those improvements, I recognized that the Toolbox could be rebranded and enhanced to better achieve its goal.
  By developing personas and analyzing pain points, I developed a strategy for transforming the Toolbox into a hub for news, knowledge, and community.
