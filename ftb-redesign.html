<!--Add in sectioning and linking within the page...this is a long one-->

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>One component of my role at the Academy is developing a design system for products like the Faculty Toolbox.
The Faculty Toolbox is a website housed within the US Air Force Academy's learning management system (LMS).
This site is intended to provide faculty with resources to effectively use the LMS for their courses.
It was apparent that design thinking had not been used to build the Toolbox.
Because of that, the Toolbox was not achieving its goal.
My challenge, then, was adapting design thinking to fit the unique needs and constraints of the Academy, and then applying that system to redesign the Toolbox.
</p>

<p>Drawing on my experience as a faculty member and online course designer, I was able to quickly spot problems with the Toolbox's information architecture, content, and lack of style guidelines.
  Since my role at the Academy serves all faculty, I knew I had to conduct user research to have a broader view of what would be useful for faculty, rather than relying just on my own experience.
  But, given the Academy is a government, military, and academic institution, there are constraints on how I am allowed to collect user research.
  Moreover, I had additional constraints since our team was brought in on a contract, and therefore had to heed the scope of the contract.
</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I was able to overcome these obstacles and redesign a website that better meets the needs of the faculty.
  We have seen continued growth in the number of faculty who have used the Toolbox, and the design system I implemented ensures that the Toolbox keeps up with the goals of the faculty.

<h2>User Research and Personas</h2>
<p>At the Academy, there is a lengthy process one has to complete to gain permission to officially survey faculty. 
  Because of that, I used the learning opportunities I was already offering as a way to conduct user research. 
  For online courses, this meant providing feedback opportunities (not surveys!) at the end of each course. 
  With face to face learning opportunities, I took time at the beginning and end of each session to informally interview attendees.
</p>

<p>One downside to conducting this type of user research is selection bias: because all learning opportunities are voluntary, I am only going to have the opportunity to gain feedback from faculty who are interested in, or use, the LMS. 
  In some ways this isn’t showstopper: currently use of the LMS is voluntary, so there isn’t much of a need to convert those who have no interest in using the LMS. 
  Noneless, using parts of the LMS will soon be mandatory, so I spoke with administrators in order to gain a more complete understanding of the different types of faculty, especially those opposed to using the LMS.
</p>

<p>From this research I found that there are 5 different types of faculty members at the Academy, each of which I captured in a persona. 
  If you would like to see each persona in full, click the name of the persona. 
  Alternately, you can view all of them in one document by opening this document: Faculty Toolbox Personas document. 
  Otherwise, here’s a quick summary of each persona and their needs and goals:
<ul>
  <li><a href=/eager-evan>Eager Evan</a>: Excited to use the LMS but lacks teaching experience, and isn’t aware of (or, sometimes, concerned with) how to implement the LMS in pedagogically effective ways. Evan needs “bite sized” instructions for using the LMS that have good pedagogy built in. </li>
  <li><a href=/veteran-val>Veteran Val</a>: Happy to use technology, but admits that she is “too old” to learn new technology like an LMS quickly. She needs how to guides that present information in small but detailed steps, and she needs ample opportunities to practice. </li>
  <li><a href=/all-in/ann>All-In Ann</a>: An early adopter of the LMS who has a “hands on” approach to trying new tools. She prefers face-to-face conversations when workshopping ideas and only needs an online resource when she is stuck, looking for new ideas, or searching for the basic instructions.  </li>
  <li><a href=/hesitant-haryy>Hesitant </a>: Self-labeled as more a researcher than a teacher, he believes that teaching already takes up too much time–-and learning an LMS will only take up more time that he could spend teaching. He needs to see that the LMS is easy to use and can save him time on activities like distributing readings and grading. </li>
  <li><a href=/old-school-ollie>Old-School Ollie</a>: Opposed to using the LMS because he sees it as a fad and believes his teaching methods are tried-and-true. Ollie doesn’t realize that he already uses technology similar to the LMS for his course, though he categorizes the LMS and the technology he uses differently. He needs to see that the LMS is, in some respects, just a different tool to accomplish the jobs he already does. </li>
</ul>
Common to all personas was a desire for information to be easy to find and the navigation to be “intuitive”. 
In this case, an “intuitive” navigation is one which maps a three-component mental model faculty have for building a course: course content and delivery, course administration, and assessment.
</p>

<h2>Retooling the Toolbox</h2>
<p>After building these personas, I turned my attention to the Toolbox. I started by looking at what had been built before I arrived at the Academy. Guided by the personas and my experience developing online courses, it was apparent that the Toolbox needed a redesign. The problems that stood out to me were:
  <ol type=1>
    <li> Site navigation that was not “intuitive” because it did not reflect the mental model faculty have for course building.</li>
    <li> Content that was not catered to the needs of the faculty at USAFA.</li>
    <li> No consistent use of fonts, headings, and colors to visually organize site content.</li>
</p>


<!--  
<h2>Phase I: First Aid</h2>
<p>During my onboarding at the Academy, I was told about the Faculty Toolbox and given some extant user research on the faculty.
I was told that the goal of the Toolbox is the provide a resource for <i>all</i> faculty to learn about the LMS.
The available user research was quite limited: the faculty at the Academy were all over the map with respect to technological ability and willingness to adopt the LMS.
Some faculty were eager to use the LMS unsure of how to do so. 
Others, regardless of technological ability, were adamantly opposed to using it.
And there were a few who were already power users of the LMS.
</p>

<h3>Problem Spotting</h3>
  <p>Even with limited user research, it was easy to find ways to improve the Toolbox.
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox.PNG" alt="Original Faculty Toolbox landing page." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto">
  <p>After looking through the Toolbox, I identified three pain points based on the research available and my own experience as a faculty member:
    <ul>
      <li>Unclear labels: The main menu for the website did not clearly indicate what kind of content was available on each page. This is a problem, because it meant that a faculty member would need to click around a lot on the site in search of content, rather than knowing where to look after opening the site.</li>
      <li>Missing information: But, unfortunately, all of that clicking did not guarantee that they would find what they were looking for. Taking into account my own experience, as well as the varied levels of knowledge of the LMS, it was apparent that the Toolbox was missing important information on how to build and maintain a course within the LMS.</li>
      <li>Inconsistent style: It was apparent that the site was put together in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner because of the inconsistent style. For instance, there was no clear use of headers and colors to distinguish types of content.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
<p>After identifying these problems, it was time to fix them. The strategy I employed started with the site's information architecture.
  By redesigning the information architecture I would be able to categorize information in a better way&mdash;thereby helping solve the unclear labels problem&mdash;and more easily see what information was missing&mdash;thus making inroads on the missing information problem.
  Moreover, a clear plan for where to place content would provide some direction for developing a style guide later on.
</p>
-->
<h3>Site Navigation</h3>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>My guiding principle when redesigning the Toolbox's navigation was this: <i>If you want faculty to learn and adopt a new tool like the LMS, you need a resource center that makes sense to them, that demonstrates the capabilities of the tool while providing information within a framework they understand and already use to build their courses.</i> While a course is presented as a whole, faculty often use a three-part mental model for constructing and thinking about their course: course content and delivery, course administration, and assessment. The problem with the top-level architecture of the orginial site (pictured below) was that it did not do this.
<br><img src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox-Menu1.png" alt="Original Faculty Toolbox navigation menu." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
As you can see, the top level navigation has a generic "Inside Your Course" menu item. This wouldn't be too bad, except the "Inside Your Course" page didn't reflect the mental model, as demonstrated by the following screenshot.
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FTB-InsideYourCourse.PNG" alt="Inside Your Course page." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
As you can see, the "Inside Your Course" page was missing both headers to distinguish types of content based on the mental model as well as content for each piece of the model. Section Enrollment deals with course administration, while rubrics deal with assessment&mdash;but there is nothing on building and delivering content. Moreover, the "Ask a Librarian" link is out of place. So, the original site navigation didn't reflect the mental model faculty use, which made the site less "intuitive".
</p>

<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>The obvious starting point, then, was to design the site navigation and menu around the categories faculty use when designing their courses. The three main categories that were missing from the existing course menu were: course tools, course administration, and assessment. Since faculty had already been using the Toolbox, I wanted to utilize as much of the existing course architecture as I could, while still enhancing the site. After all, making too drastic of changes could have negatively impacted the use of the Toolbox.
</p>

<p>With those ideas in mind, I took the existing menu and sketched out prototypes for the top-level architecture.
  <br><img src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype1.png" alt="Menu prototype number 1." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
  <br><img src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype2.png" alt="Menu prototype number 2." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
After showing these ideas to my team and some faculty, it was clear that I was on the right track. So, after a little more tweaking, the Faculty Resources portion of the course menu was finished.
  <br><img src="/img/FTB-MenuFinal.png" alt="The final version of the Faculty Resources portion of the site menu." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto">
</p>

<p>Along with clearer categories, one advantage of this way of organizing site content is that it takes advantage of the user interface to provide a snapshot of the LMS's capabilities. For instance, when I open up the "Building Your Course" page, I am presented shown what capabilities the LMS has for course building. In the case of the following screenshot, I would immediately know that the LMS has tools for teaching, the ability to add videos, and the ability to release content as I see fit.
  <br><img src="/img/FTB-ContentArea1-List.png" alt="Building Your Course content." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
This is a great feature for all users. For those wanting to use the LMS, they can quickly determine if it has the capabilities they are looking for. For those opposed to or skeptical of using the LMS, they might be surprised at what it can do and decide to learn more about it (and, hopefully, decide to then use it).
</p>
  
<!--
<h4>Preliminary Content Roadmap</h4>
<p>The original Toolbox contained some resources for using Blackboard but was missing some key pieces of content.
</p>
 <img src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Faculty resources from original toolbox." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto">
<br>
  <p>The resources listed in the screenshot (managing section enrollment, Safe Assign, course evaluations, library resources, publisher information, rubric resources, and adding scrollbars on a Mac) 
  are good resources for faculty&mdash;who already know how to use the LMS. 
  But the original Toolbox did not cater to the needs of those with little technological ability.
  Nor did the original Toolbox try to convince those opposed to adopting the LMS to give it a try, by, for instance, talking about how some of the tools are easy to use and can save a lot of time.
  (If you're curious about just how much time some of these tools can save, check out my other portfolio item on using <a href=/cw-assessment>digital rubrics</a>.)
</p>

<p>By creating distinct nodes in the information architecture for course building, course administration, and assessment, it was easy to see what content was missing for the different types of faculty. 
  For instance, there was not a content item that provided a high-level overview of common teaching tools.
  Such an overview would be beneficial for those with little to no knowledge of the LMS because it would provide a starting point for learning more about the LMS. 
  But this type of overview could also be used to communicate the time-saving component of using the LMS to those faculty who were opposed to, or skeptical of, adopting it. 
  So, the redesigned information architecture provided not only a way to place existing content within the new site menu, but also a framework within which to build a content roadmap that would take into account the varied abilities of the faculty.

<h4>Style Guide</h4> -->
<!--Style guide: mention how you want colors to distinguish types of content, which is not the case if you organize the site another way: it circles back to the "IA first" approach.
Missing Content: be sure to highlight one or two specific things that were found missing.-->
<!--<p>The third component to Phase I was cleaning up the formatting of the Toolbox and implementing a style guide that would ensure consistent and meaningful formatting.
  In some cases, the formatting was just inconsistent, as shown here (and, yes, above in the previous screenshot):
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Different fonts and content type." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
  Here the bottom item is different from the preceding ones in two respects. 
  First, the font is not the same as the others. 
  Second, whereas the first three items are links to content, the fourth just is the content.
</p>

<p>In other cases, the formatting seemed to lack a clear purpose and/or was unhelpful.
  For example, the highlighting in the welcome message does not provide much of a contrast to the background.
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox-Welcome.png" alt="Lack of contrast between the background and the highlight." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
  It's unclear what that highlighting is supposed to communicate.
  And the alternating color of the titles for Workshop presentations seems to only highlight that the content items are distinct.
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea3.PNG" alt="Different colors for the titles of content items." style="max-width: 40%;height: auto"><br>
  But there are line breaks and icons that do this, so the color coding doesn't serve much of a purpose.
  (For instance, it could be used to group content: one color for assessment-related presentations, another for communication-related presentations, etc.)
</p>

<p>These formatting issues were easy to fix. For instance, using highlighting to emphasize important information such as warngings, known issues, and system downtime.
  Using a consistent font across all content is easy as well, since the built-in text editor for the LMS has a default font (and style guide).
  Finally, I decided to implement the following guidelines for color coding:
  <ul>
    <li>Black font for content.</li>
    <li>Blue (#0000FF) font for in-page headers to help further organize content (such as when a list of quizzes begins).</li>
    <li>Dark Cyan-Azure (#0099CC) for quizzes.</li>
  </ul>
  In the case of the Building Your Course page, the end result looks like this:
  <br><img src="/img/FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Building Your Course page." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
</p>

<h4>Phase I Outcomes</h4>
<p>The first phase of redesigning and rebranding focused on first aid. 
  Using extant user research, I quickly found that the Toolbox, as it was created, was not meeting the needs of all faculty.
  The three main problems were unclear labels, missing information, and inconsistent style.
  To fix these problems I redesigned the information architecture, drafted a preliminary content roadmap, and implemented a style guide.
  These actions laid a foundation on which I could rebrand the Toolbox and better leverage its capabilities to provide a hub for LMS news, knowledge, and community.
</p>

<h2>Phase II: Rebrand and Enhance</h2>
<p>To really turn the Toolbox into a resource for all faculty, I needed to do more than perform some first aid to the site.
  With encouragement from the leadership at the Academy, I began collaborating with the Center for Educational Innovation (CEI) to continue developing the toolbox.
  The first step in this endeavor was to do a more thorough job understanding the faculty. 
  Working with the CEI, I conducted more user research and, along with the research I had already been given, developed three personas to guide the design process for Phase II.
  From these personas I was able to identify pain points unique to different types of faculty, as well as ones common to all.
  I then began to ideate, prototype, and test solutions to these pain points.
  Realizing that this would be a continual process, I also began to develop a design system for the Toolbox.
</p>

<h3>Persona "Deep Dive"</h3>
In my position as the LMS Training Lead, I was able to informally interview a number of faculty about their experience with the LMS.
From these interviews, I developed three personas that captured the spectrum of experiences I encountered.
These heart of these personas is not much different from what was outlined above:
some faculty are opposed to or skeptical of using the LMS to teach, some are interested in using the LMS but do not know where to start, and a smaller number are power users of the LMS.
</p>
