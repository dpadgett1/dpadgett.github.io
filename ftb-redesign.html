<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The Faculty Toolbox is a website housed within the US Air Force Academy's learning management system (LMS).
This site is intended to provide faculty with resources to effectively use the LMS for their courses.
  When I started working at the Academy, I quickly realized that the Toolbox's organization was not conducive to that goal.
  So, I performed some first aid on the Toolbox: re-doing the information architecture, adding a table of contents, and developing and applying a style guide.
  Even with those improvements, I recognized that the Toolbox could be rebranded and enhanced to better achieve its goal.
  By developing personas and analyzing pain points, I developed a strategy for transforming the Toolbox into a hub for news, knowledge, and community.
</p>

<p>Through rebuilding and rebranding the Toolbox I developed and implemented a <b>design system</b> that can be used for any LMS-related product at the Academy.
  For the Toolbox, this system helps ensure that it is always useful for its users, the faculty.

<h2>Phase I: First Aid</h2>
<p>During my onboarding at the Academy, I was told about the Faculty Toolbox and given some extant user research on the faculty.
I was told that the goal of the Toolbox is the provide a resource for <i>all</i> faculty to learn about the LMS.
The available user research was quite limited: the faculty at the Academy were all over the map with respect to technological ability and willingness to adopt the LMS.
Some faculty were eager to use the LMS unsure of how to do so. 
Others, regardless of technological ability, were adamantly opposed to using it.
And there were a few who were already power users of the LMS.
</p>

<h3>Problem Spotting</h3>
  <p>Even with limited user research, it was easy to find ways to improve the Toolbox.
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox.PNG" alt="Original Faculty Toolbox landing page." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto">
  <p>After looking through the Toolbox, I identified three pain points based on the research available and my own experience as a faculty member:
    <ul>
      <li>Unclear labels: The main menu for the website did not clearly indicate what kind of content was available on each page. This is a problem, because it meant that a faculty member would need to click around a lot on the site in search of content, rather than knowing where to look after opening the site.</li>
      <li>Missing information: But, unfortunately, all of that clicking did not guarantee that they would find what they were looking for. Taking into account my own experience, as well as the varied levels of knowledge of the LMS, it was apparent that the Toolbox was missing important information on how to build and maintain a course within the LMS.</li>
      <li>Inconsistent style: It was apparent that the site was put together in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner because of the inconsistent style. For instance, there was no clear use of headers and colors to distinguish types of content.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
<p>After identifying these problems, it was time to fix them. The strategy I employed started with the site's information architecture.
  By redesigning the information architecture I would be able to categorize information in a better way&mdash;thereby helping solve the unclear labels problem&mdash;and more easily see what information was missing&mdash;thus making inroads on the missing information problem.
  Moreover, a clear plan for where to place content would provide some direction for developing a style guide later on.
</p>

<h4>Information Architecture</h4>
<p>My guiding principle when redesigning the Toolbox's information architecture was this: <i>If you want faculty to learn and adopt a new tool like the LMS, you need a resource center that makes sense to them, that demonstrates the capabilities of the tool while providing information within a framework they understand and already use to build their courses.</i>
  While a course is presented as a whole, faculty often chunk pieces of courses in particular ways.
  A useful site menu should replicate the way most faculty categorize the different aspects of building a course. 
  The problem with the top-level architecture of the orginial site (pictured below) was that it did not do this.
   <br><img src="/img/OLD-FacultyToolbox-Menu1.png" alt="Original Faculty Toolbox navigation menu." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
  In particular, "Inside Your Course" contained information about all aspects of course creation. 
</p>

<p>The obvious starting point, then, was to design a site menu around the categories faculty use when designing their courses.
  The three main categories that were missing from the existing course menu were: course tools, course administration, and assessment.
  Since faculty had already been using the Toolbox, I wanted to utilize as much of the existing course architecture as I could, while still enhancing the site.
  After all, making too drastic of changes could have negatively impacted the use of the Toolbox.
</p>

  With those ideas in mind, I took the existing menu and sketched out prototypes for the top-level architecture.

  <br><img src="/img/FTB-MenuPrototype2.png" alt="Menu prototype number 2." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
  After showing these ideas to my team and some faculty, it was clear that I was on the right track. 
  So, after a little more tweaking, the Faculty Resources portion of the course menu was finished.

</p>

<h4>Preliminary Content Roadmap</h4>
<p>The original Toolbox contained some resources for using Blackboard but was missing some key pieces of content.
  
  <br><img src="/img/OLD-FTB-ContentArea1.PNG" alt="Faculty resources from original toolbox." style="max-width: 100%;height: auto"><br>
 
  The resources listed in the screenshot (managing section enrollment, Safe Assign, course evaluations, library resources, publisher information, rubric resources, and adding scrollbars on a Mac) 
  are good resources for faculty&mdash;who already know how to use the LMS. 
  But the original Toolbox did not cater to the needs of those with little technological ability.
  Nor did the original Toolbox try to convince those opposed to adopting the LMS to give it a try, by, for instance, talking about how some of the tools are easy to use and can save a lot of time.
  (If you're curious about just how much time some of these tools can save, check out my other portfolio item on using <a href=/cw-assessment>digital rubrics</a>.)

<h4>Style Guide</h4>

<!--Style guide: mention how you want colors to distinguish types of content, which is not the case if you organize the site another way: it circles back to the "IA first" approach.
Missing Content: be sure to highlight one or two specific things that were found missing.-->
