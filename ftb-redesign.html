title: Rebuilding And Rebranding The Faculty Toolbox

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The Faculty Toolbox is a website housed within the US Air Force Academy's learning management system (LMS).
This site is intended to provide faculty with resources to effectively use the LMS for their courses.
  When I started working at the Academy, I quickly realized that the Toolbox's organization was not conducive to that goal.
  So, I performed some first aid on the Toolbox: re-doing the information architecture, adding a table of contents, and developing and applying a style guide.
  Even with those improvements, I recognized that the Toolbox could be rebranded and enhanced to better achieve its goal.
  By developing personas and analyzing pain points, I developed a strategy for transforming the Toolbox into a hub for news, knowledge, and community.
</p>

<p>Through rebuilding and rebranding the Toolbox I developed and implemented a <b>design system</b> that can be used for any LMS-related product at the Academy.
  For the Toolbox, this system helps ensure that it is always useful for its users, the faculty.

<h2>Phase I: First Aid</h2>
<p>During my onboarding at the Academy, I was told about the Faculty Toolbox and given some extant user research on the faculty.
I was told that the <strong>goal</strong> of the Toolbox is the provide a resource for <i>all</i> faculty to learn about the LMS.
The available <strong>user research</strong> was quite limited: the faculty at the Academy were all over the map with respect to technological ability and willingness to adopt the LMS.
Some faculty were eager to use the LMS unsure of how to do so. 
Others, regardless of technological ability, were adamantly opposed to using it.
And there were a few who were already power users of the LMS.
</p>

<h3>Problem Spotting</h3>
  <p>Even with limited user research, it was easy to find ways to improve the Toolbox.
  <!--[IMAGE OF OLD TOOLBOX]-->
  <p>After looking through the Toolbox, I identified three pain points based on the research available and my own experience as a faculty member:
    <ul>
      <li>Unclear labels: The main menu for the website did not clearly indicate what kind of content was available on each page. This is a problem, because it meant that a faculty member would need to click around a lot on the site in search of content, rather than knowing where to look after opening the site.</li>
      <li>Missing information: But, unfortunately, all of that clicking did not guarantee that they would find what they were looking for. Taking into account my own experience, as well as the varied levels of knowledge of the LMS, it was apparent that the Toolbox was missing important information on how to build and maintain a course within the LMS.</li>
      <li>Inconsistent style: It was apparent that the site was put together in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner because of the inconsistent style. For instance, there was no clear use of headers and colors to distinguish types of content.</li>
    </ul>
